Problem: 36 - Valid Sudoku
Difficulty: Medium
Topic: Arrays / Hashing

Approach:
- Use 3 hash sets for each row, column, and 3x3 box.
- As you loop through the board, skip empty cells.
- For each filled cell, check if the number already exists in its row, column, or box.
- If it does, return False immediately.
- Otherwise, record the number in the corresponding sets.
- If no conflicts are found after scanning the whole board, return True.

Time Complexity: O(1) 
# (Always a fixed 9x9 board â†’ 81 operations max, treated as constant time)
Space Complexity: O(1) 
# (At most 81 entries stored across sets, still constant because the board size is fixed)
