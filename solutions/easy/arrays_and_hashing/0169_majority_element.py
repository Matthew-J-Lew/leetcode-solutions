Problem: 169 - Majority Element
Difficulty: Easy
Topic: Hashmap / Counting

Approach:
- Use a hashmap (dictionary) to count the frequency of each element in nums.
- As we count, if any elementâ€™s frequency exceeds n/2, return it immediately.
- This works because the majority element is guaranteed to exist.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
